I am a law graduate from Ovidius University who spent two and a half years working in banking before transitioning to the technology industry, specifically quality assurance. 
I rediscovered a long-lost passion for technology after completing a Manual Testing course. Afterward, I started searching for opportunities and landed my first entry-level Functional QA Tester role at Testronic. 
I am thrilled to have started this journey with video games, as I am an avid gamer. Alongside my work, I have begun learning Java and have a basic understanding of SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am eager to grow, gain hands-on experience, and contribute through volunteer work.
