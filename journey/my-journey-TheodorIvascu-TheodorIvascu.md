Hi, my name is Theodor, but you can call me Theo. I’m 26 years old. 
I am a law graduate from Ovidius University who spent two and a half years working in banking before transitioning to the technology industry, specifically quality assurance. 
I rediscovered a long-lost passion for technology after completing a Manual Web Testing course. 
Afterward, I started searching for opportunities and landed my first entry-level Functional QA Tester role at Testronic.
I am thrilled to have started this journey with video games, as I am an avid gamer. Alongside my work, I have begun learning Java and have a basic understanding of SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My biggest objective is to gain experience in manual testing and automation testing while working toward obtaining my ISTQB certification. I am eager to grow, gain hands-on experience, and contribute through volunteer work.

I first heard about Asociația Oportunități și Cariere through LinkedIn and my Manual Web Testing course.
