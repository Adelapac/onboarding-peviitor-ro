Currently, I am working as a junior manual tester with one year of experience, specializing in testing professional
monitors and desktop applications designed for these monitors. To expand my skill set and broaden my expertise, I am
eager to learn web testing and automation testing. I am currently focusing on mastering Java and Selenium to enhance 
my proficiency in these areas. I believe that the Oportunitati and Cariere project will significantly contribute to
the growth and development of my skills
