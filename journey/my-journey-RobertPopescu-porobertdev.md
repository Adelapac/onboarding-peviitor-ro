Hi, I'm Robert aka @porobertdev, a self-taught developer. All my social links are [here](https://links.porobertdev.com). I tweet regularly.

Here's a little story about me.

The first time I have touched programming was at high school, where I've learned some C++ (spoiler: I don't remember much). I liked it, but I was wasting most of my time playing stupid games instead of studying, so I remember that I was left behind when I got to learning about the backtracking algorithm.

Over the years:

- **I tried to get back into programming** with Python for like 3 times through *automatetheboringstuff* and *Python MOOC* courses, but I always gave up too fast because of the impostor syndrome and I procrastinated.
- **I have worked on two Android phones**. Basically, building & porting the popular [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) - a different Open Source flavour of Android, that I shared with the xda-developers community. I worked with git, android tools, and even Hex Ray's IDA to reverse-engineer pre-compiled blobs. Lots of debugging, *aha*-moments and I *hate*-moments. I provided support and updates with changelogs, and I got a few small donations in exchange. The most notable and hard work I did can be seen [https://xdaforums.com/f/huawei-nova-nova-plus-roms-kernels-recoveries.5820/](here) - all posts by *#Henkate* (my old username), like [this](https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-7-1-2-unofficial-lineageos-14-1-25-05-2018.3704606/) or [this](https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-8-1-0-ota-unofficial-lineageos-15-1-15-11-2018.3838338/). And here's my old [https://github.com/skinzor](https://github.com/skinzor). I can prove ownership anytime.
- always tried to automate different stuff with Tasker app on Android, which uses some basic programming concepts.
- did distrohopping, and at some point I could say `I use Arch btw`

**In April 2023**, I was feeling tired of my job (warehouse worker, still going on at this moment) and I took the decision to try programming again. Why? Because nothing else interests me at all and I have always been tech-savy.
I didn't want to start with Python once again. So I did a lil bit of research and started with Web & JavaScript this time through **The Odin Project** course.

So here I am. Still going on and I'm not going to stop this time.

I currently have knowledge about both, Frontend and Backend. It might be too early to say, but I think I enjoy more the backend side.

I didn't create any mind-blowing projects yet, but my first **full-stack apps** that I built recently are:

1. [Mini MessageBoard](https://secret-ruthanne-porobertdev-614629eb.koyeb.app/) - a live-chat app using the WebSocket protocol, featuring a simple admin dashboard by authenticating using PassportJS and a session.
2. [HashCode](https://hashcode.porobert.dev/) - a Pastebin alternative, where I've focused on the API REST design and implementing some security features.

My current **interests**:

- Scraping
- Arduino/ESP32
- AI/ML
- Mobile apps
- Chrome/GNOME/VSCode Extensions
- indiehacking, thus, design & marketing too.

And my current **tech-stack**:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- AstroJS
- NodeJS & ExpressJS
- Jest
- SQL / PostgreSQL

[I know some DSA too](https://github.com/porobertdev/dsa-solutions), but right now I'd need to recap a bit.

I have some experience with scraping:

1. When I've used Python, I've built a **manga scraper** for a friend.
2. And with JavaScript, I built a **Youtube scraper** that fetches N search results with all info such as title, thumbnail, likes, comments, and also channel info. I've used Puppeteer since I couldn't find another way at that time (considering the website is server-side rendered), and had to implement an auto-scroller.
   It looks like it still works right now:

Now that I know some backend, I plan to re-create it and find a way to make it much faster, and also create a frontend.

Btw, there's a very interesting Open Source scraping framework that I found interesting: https://crawlee.dev/

## Goal

That being said, I'm here to experiment different things, gain more experience and build connections.
