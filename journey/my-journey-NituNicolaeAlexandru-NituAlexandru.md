Hello!

I'm Alex, a junior web developer, beginning my journey in front-end development. I am eager to join the project and start contributing.

For the past year, I have been enrolled in a Full Stack Developer course at GoIT Academy. During this time, I have gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I have also become proficient in using tools such as GitHub, Git, npm, JS/React libraries and Parcel. Through this course, I have learned not only the technical skills necessary for web development but also how to work effectively in a team setting and manage collaborative projects.

**Goals:**

- Hands-on Knowledge and Experience in Web Development (Front-end and Back-end): I'm looking forward to gaining practical experience in both front-end and back-end development, which will enhance my overall understanding and proficiency in creating full-stack applications.

- Understand the Wider Picture in Combining HTML, CSS, JS, React & Node: I aim to develop a holistic understanding of how these core technologies work together to build dynamic, responsive, and efficient web applications.

- Use Front-end Technologies and Tools: I plan to become proficient in various front-end technologies and tools, including React, Bootstrap, Tailwind, jQuery, and Node.js. Additionally, I want to learn how to integrate APIs and manage databases effectively.

- Learn TypeScript & Next.js: Expanding my skill set by learning TypeScript and Next.js is a priority for me, as these technologies are increasingly important in modern web development.

- Networking: I seek to build a strong professional network within the web development community, which will help me learn from experienced developers and stay updated with industry trends.

- Experience: Gaining real-world experience through this project will be invaluable for my growth as a developer, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.

- Finding a Frontend Developer Role: Ultimately, my goal is to secure a frontend developer role where I can continue to learn, grow, and contribute to impactful projects.

This organization has been highly recommended to me by a colleague from GoIT Academy, and I am excited about the opportunity to join and contribute to your team.
